# CentDB

A lightweight simulation of a database system implemented in Java.

CentDB is a basic, educational project that demonstrates how core database functionalities can be modeled from scratch â€” including table creation, data insertion, and query execution â€” without relying on any external database engine.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create and manage multiple tables
- Insert and store records in memory
- Perform simple query simulations
- Object-oriented Java design for clarity and modularity
- CLI interface for user interaction

## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

This project was developed as part of my journey to understand the inner workings of database engines. By building a simplified model, I was able to deepen my understanding of:

- Data storage and retrieval
- Table schema handling
- Query interpretation and command parsing
- Java's capabilities for structuring backend logic

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Environment:** CLI
- **Tools:** Standard Java Libraries (no external DB dependencies)
